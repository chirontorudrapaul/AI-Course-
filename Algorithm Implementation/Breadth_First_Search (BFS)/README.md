# Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm Implementation in C++

## Overview

This program implements the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm, a graph traversal strategy that explores all the nodes at a given depth level before moving on to the next level. It is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

## What is BFS?

BFS works by:

*   Starting with an initial node (or root node).
*   Exploring all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
*   Using a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be visited.

## Code Structure

### Functions

1.  `bfs(int no_vertices, int root)`:
    *   Performs the BFS traversal on the graph.
    *   Uses a queue and an array to track visited nodes.
    *   Prints the visited nodes.

2.  `main()`:
    *   Takes user input for: number of vertices, number of edges, graph connections, and root node.
    *   Builds the graph as an adjacency matrix.
    *   Calls `bfs()` and prints the result.

## How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites

*   A C++ compiler (e.g., **g++**) installed on your system.

### Steps

1.  Save the code as `bfs.cpp`.
2.  Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3.  Compile the code:
    ```bash
g++ bfs.cpp -o bfs
```
4.  Run the executable:
    ```bash
./bfs
```

## Sample Execution

This example uses a graph with **6 vertices** and **7 edges**.

### Input

```
6 7
0 1
0 2
1 3
2 3
2 4
3 5
4 5
0
```

### Output

```
0 1 2 3 4 5
Process returned 0 (0x0)  execution time : 5.654 s
Press any key to continue.
```

### Explanation

*   The algorithm starts at node **0** and explores all its neighbors at each depth level.
*   The visited nodes are printed in the order they are traversed.

## Complexity

*   **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices, and E is the number of edges.
*   **Space Complexity**: O(V), as the algorithm needs to store the visited nodes.

## Applications

1.  **Graph Traversal**: BFS is used in graph traversal problems, such as finding connected components.
2.  **Network Analysis**: It is used in network analysis to find the shortest path between two nodes.
3.  **Web Crawling**: BFS can be used in web crawling to traverse the web graph.

## Advantages

1.  **Efficiency**: BFS is efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
2.  **Simplicity**: It is a simple algorithm to implement.

## Disadvantages

1.  **Not Suitable for Weighted Graphs**: BFS is not suitable for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.
2.  **Space Requirements**: The algorithm requires significant space to store the visited nodes.

## How it Works

1.  **Initialization**: The algorithm starts with an initial node and a queue.
2.  **Node Exploration**: The algorithm explores all the neighbors of the current node.
3.  **Queue Operations**: The algorithm uses queue operations (enqueue and dequeue) to manage the nodes to be visited.
